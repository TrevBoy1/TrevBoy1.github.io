		<h1>Wausau High School Unification Under Controversy</h1>
			<h3>Wausau's plans to merge its eastern and western high schools continue to stir local controversies</h3>
			<hr/>
				<h4>The moderately populated city of Wausau has had continuous plans to merge the city's titular eastern and western high schools into a singular entity. No major changes are underway, and it is becoming more likely that the situation will remain this way. The Wausau School Board declared a 5-4 vote against the merger.</h4>

</br>
				<h4>Logistics involving this unification have been a concern to local parents, largely about bus navigation. Rib Mountain Elementary has been the subject of a different merge attempt, with their instance being especially troubling considering that many families may have their abilities to use a local bus compromised.</h4>
